User Manuals and Undocumented Features
========================================

CharmHigh provides a manual with their machine. This directory attempts to track the changes to the manual over time as well as provide a better english translation of the manual. Additionally, the [Desktop Pick and Place google group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/desktop-pick-and-place) has been poking at the 'secret' menu system and attempting to discern the various functions.
